            # yum install qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-python virt-install
    
    - Create ManageIQ VM using existing image
        - Create VM using ```virt-install``` command

                # sudo virt-install --virt-type kvm  --import --name ManageIQ  --memory 12288 --vcpus 4 --cpu host  --disk manageiq-openstack-gaprindashvili-5.qc2,format=qcow2,bus=virtio  --network default,model=virtio   --os-type=linux --os-variant=centos7.0   --graphics spice
    
    - Launch VM using ```virsh ```
            
            # virsh start ManageIQ

- Using docker image

    Docker image for ManageIQ is available. It can be run in Docker container. There are also other options like [Public cloud](http://manageiq.org/docs/get-started/cloud) or [Vagrant](http://manageiq.org/docs/get-started/vagrant) to get started with ManageIQ. It can run everywhere Docker is available.

    First thing, you have to install Docker in your system. Follow instructions in [Docker docs](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) to install Docker.

    Start Docker service using

        $ sudo service docker start 
    or do 

        $ sudo systemctl start docker 
    ### Step 1: Pull Docker image of ManageIQ

        $ sudo docker pull manageiq/manageiq 
    or

        sudo docker pull manageiq/manageiq:gaprindashvili-4 
    It will download ManageIQ image from Docker registry. To see image list, run this

        $ sudo docker images ls 

    ### Stpe 2: Run Docker container

        $ sudo docker run --privileged -d -p 8443:443 manageiq/manageiq 

    or

        $ sudo docker run --privileged -d -p 8443:443 manageiq/manageiq:gaprindashvili-4

    It will run container in detached mode. ``` -p 8443:443``` will forward your base machine's _8443_ port requests to docker container's _443_ port. To see a list of running containers, execute

        $ sudo docker ps


    Now ManageIQ container is up and running at IP address [https://127.0.0.1:8443](https://127.0.0.1:8443)

    It has username as *admin* and the password is *smartvm*. Get the login and explore the world of ManageIQ.

    ### Step 3: To commit the changes Commit the container

    It can be useful to commit a containerâ€™s file changes or settings into a new image. This allows you to debug a container by running an interactive shell, or to export a working dataset to another server. 

        $ docker commit "container_id" manageiq

    this saves all changes and data, next time run the ``` manageiq``` container.
